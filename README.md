# Snakes-and-Ladders-CG-Project
A group project in my Computer Graphics course of Engineering, in which we created a GUI of snakes and ladders game to give users an option to roll the dice and play the game accordingly. Used glut library for the purpose of graphics and built a board using lines. Pawn was displayed using circles; snakes and ladders were displayed using GL lines.

Run the code.
Useful for CG subject in VTU for 6th sem.
